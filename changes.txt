1. The comments for my initial submission of MP1 were as follows:
Make sure you check your code for formatting using `mvn checkstyle:check -q`,
there were a lot of checkstyle errors.

SOLUTION: 
I fixed this issue by going through the checklist of checkstyle errors using
`mvn checkstyle:check -q` and adding/changing the required material. This included
adding javadoc segments for all of my methods, removing blank spaces after code lines, 
adding/removing spaces before/after operators or comparators, and removing "magic numbers".
This proccess spanned all of my files. The result is that there are no longer any checkstyle
errors in my code.

2. You had 7 tests that failed (gave the wrong output) & 2 tests that
had errors where the index was out of bounds so make sure you
handle edge cases well! Make sure you test your code using
`mvn test` before you submit it.

SOLUTION:
I fixed this issue by going back through my code and changing output of the Caesar file to print nothing
when the input in invalid (producing null, the desired output), and adding "Error: " before one of my error
messages in AllCaesar. I also realized that I wasn't checking if the message or key was valid in Caesar, so I added code to check that.
These changes resulted in my code producing no errors using the provided tests.
